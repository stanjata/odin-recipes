    <h1>Pizza recipe</h1>
    <img src="../Img/pizza.jpg">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Roman-style pizza has a long-fermented thicker crust, and is absolutely awesome. Topped with prepared sauce, sausage, sweet peppers, and three cheeses, or with whatever you like, you'll want to make this on repeat.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 1/4 cups bread flour (500 grams)</li>
      <li>1 rounded teaspoon dry yeast (3.5 grams)</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoons olive oil (20 ml), plus 2 teaspoons more to oil containe</li>
      <li>6 ounces Italian sausage</li>
      <li>1 cup diced sweet peppers and onions</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>For dough, mix together flour, yeast, and water with a wooden spoon until almost all flour has disappeared and a rough dough is formed.</li>
      <li>Add salt and olive oil and continue mixing with a spoon for about 3 minutes until a smooth, very soft and sticky dough forms. Clean off spoon and scrape down bowl. Cover and let rest 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Transfer dough into an oiled container with a lid, rub dough with a few drops of olive oil and cover. Refrigerate for 24 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
      <li>Transfer dough to the counter. With damp hands press and stretch dough into a square about 15 inches wide. Fold in half, and then in half again to create a rectangle. Fold rectangle into thirds, and turn over so the seam side is down.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, prepare toppings: Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, breaking up any clumps with a spatula, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pan; set aside to cool. Add red peppers and onions to the same skillet, and cook and stir just until they begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes; remove and set aside.</li>
      <li>Transfer dough to the prepared sheet pan. Use oiled fingers to press dough into a rectangle that almost covers the pan. If dough is too elastic to stay in place, let it rest for a minute, and then continue stretching and pressing into place.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove pizza crust to a cooling rack to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Remove parchment from pan if used, then return crust to the pan.</li>
    </ol>
